## Step 1: Define the Core UI Foundations

Color Palette (primary, secondary, background, text, accents)
    → This will give consistency across all pages.

Fonts & Typography (headings, body text, buttons)
    → Choose a professional, modern Google Font.

Layout Style (navbar style, sidebar vs topbar, card style)
    → Sets the overall structure of the app.

Component Theme (buttons, inputs, forms, modals, etc.)
    → How interactive elements will look.

## Step 2: Think About the Pages We Need

### For a Meeting Booking App, typical pages could be:
    Home / Dashboard → Overview of upcoming meetings, quick actions.
    Bookings Page → List + create + edit + delete bookings.
    Profile Page → User info & settings.
    Admin Page (if you have admin role) → Manage users/bookings.
    Login / Register → Authentication.

## Step 3: Decide the Look & Feel

I’ll suggest a modern but minimal look:
    Primary Color: #2563eb (blue-600) → main brand color (buttons, highlights).
    Secondary Color: #facc15 (yellow-400) → accent color for highlights.
    Background: #f9fafb (light gray).
    Text: #111827 (dark gray/black for headings) & #374151 (normal text).
    Font: Poppins
    (clean & professional).
