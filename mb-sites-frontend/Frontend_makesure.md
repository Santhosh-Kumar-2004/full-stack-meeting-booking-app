## Step 1: Define the Core UI Foundations

Color Palette (primary, secondary, background, text, accents)
    → This will give consistency across all pages.

Fonts & Typography (headings, body text, buttons)
    → Choose a professional, modern Google Font.

Layout Style (navbar style, sidebar vs topbar, card style)
    → Sets the overall structure of the app.

Component Theme (buttons, inputs, forms, modals, etc.)
    → How interactive elements will look.

## Step 2: Think About the Pages We Need

For a Meeting Booking App, typical pages could be:

Home / Dashboard → Overview of upcoming meetings, quick actions.

Bookings Page → List + create + edit + delete bookings.

Profile Page → User info & settings.

Admin Page (if you have admin role) → Manage users/bookings.

Login / Register → Authentication.
