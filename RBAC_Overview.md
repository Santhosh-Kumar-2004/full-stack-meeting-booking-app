# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in FastAPI

## üß© Overview

RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) is a security mechanism that restricts access to resources based on a user's role within the system.  
In this FastAPI project, RBAC is implemented to separate normal users from administrators ‚Äî only admins can perform certain privileged actions such as viewing all registered users.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How RBAC Works in This Project

### 1. **Role Assignment on Registration**
When a user registers via `/auth/register`:
- The backend checks if their email exists in the `.env` variable `ADMIN_EMAILS`.
- If yes ‚Üí the user is automatically assigned the role **"admin"**.
- Otherwise ‚Üí the user gets the default role **"user"**.

**Code snippet (from `users.py`):**
```python
role = "admin" if user.email in ADMIN_EMAILS else "user"
```

This ensures that admin rights are not hardcoded but are instead controlled externally via environment variables ‚Äî improving flexibility and security.

---

### 2. **JWT Token Role Embedding**
During login, a JWT token is created using:
```python
access_token = create_access_token(data={
    "sub": db_user.email,
    "name": db_user.name,
    "role": db_user.role
})
```
This token carries the user's identity and role.  
Frontend stores it in `localStorage` and attaches it in the header when calling protected endpoints.

---

### 3. **Authorization Check (Backend)**
Every protected route uses the dependency `get_current_user`, which:
- Verifies the JWT token.
- Extracts the user info.
- Fetches the user from the database.

Then, specific routes (like `/auth/`) check for admin privileges:
```python
if current_user.role != "admin":
    raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="Operation not permitted")
```
This ensures **only admins** can access such endpoints.

## üß† Mistakes Encountered and Fixes

### ‚ùå Mistake 1: Admin Email Not Recognized
**Issue:** Newly added admin emails in `.env` were not granting admin privileges.  
**Root Cause:** FastAPI doesn‚Äôt automatically reload `.env` values ‚Äî the backend used an outdated in-memory value.  
**Fix:** Restarted the FastAPI server after updating `.env`.

> ‚úÖ Tip: Always restart your backend after modifying environment variables.

---

### ‚ùå Mistake 2: Old Admin User Stayed as ‚ÄúUser‚Äù
**Issue:** A user registered before `.env` was updated kept the `role="user"` even after changes.  
**Fix:** Deleted that user record manually from the database and re-registered after restart.

> ‚úÖ Tip: Role assignment happens only **during registration**, not after.  
> To change roles later, it must be done manually via the database or an admin route.

---

### ‚ùå Mistake 3: Token Not Updating on Login
**Issue:** When logging in as a new user, the token in `localStorage` was not being updated.  
**Root Cause:** The frontend didn‚Äôt overwrite the previous token properly.  
**Fix:** Updated `Login.jsx` to explicitly call:
```js
localStorage.setItem("token", access_token);
```
Now, each login replaces the old token with the latest valid one.

## üí° Real-World RBAC Flow

Here‚Äôs how RBAC typically works in a professional system:

1. **User Authentication:**
   - User logs in using credentials.
   - A JWT is issued containing their `role` and other claims.

2. **Access Token Validation:**
   - Every request to a protected endpoint sends the token in the `Authorization` header.

3. **Role Enforcement:**
   - Backend checks the `role` claim in the token or from DB.
   - Grants or denies access based on the required permission.

4. **Example Roles in a Real App:**
   - `admin`: Full access ‚Äî manage users, view all data, configure system.
   - `manager`: Can manage specific groups or teams.
   - `user`: Basic privileges ‚Äî can only manage personal data.
   - `guest`: Read-only or temporary access.

5. **Best Practice:**
   - Avoid hardcoding roles in logic ‚Äî define permissions in config or database.
   - Regularly review admin assignments.
   - Ensure token expiration and revocation policies.

## üß≠ Summary of Lessons Learned

| Concept | Mistake | Fix | Key Takeaway |
|----------|----------|-----|--------------|
| Environment Variables | Forgot to restart backend after `.env` changes | Restart FastAPI server | Always reload the backend after changing `.env` |
| Role Assignment | User role not updating | Delete old user and re-register | Role assigned only once during registration |
| Token Handling | Old token remained active | Replaced token on login | Always overwrite the old token on successful login |

---

## üöÄ Conclusion

RBAC provides a structured, secure way to control access in applications.  
By using environment-based admin assignment, JWT-based authentication, and backend route checks, this project achieves a clean, real-world RBAC setup suitable for modern web apps.
